             <div class="abtJava">
             <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object oriented language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and
                 lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host
                 environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over
                 them.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="listofjava">
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="">Variable Declaration</a>JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee,
                    a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="purpletext">var x;</span></li>
                    <li><a href="">Variable Assignment</a>Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to al variable.<span class="purpletext">var x = 10;</span></li></li>
                    <li><a href="">Data Types</a>Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span class="purpletext">true</span> or <span class="purpletext">false;</span> null  - <span class="purpletext">null</span>aka nothing; Number - <span class="purpletext">42</span> or <span class="purpletext">3.14159;</span>String - <span class="purpletext">"Coding Dojo Rocks":</span>Array - <span class="purpletext">[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span class="purpletext">{first_name: 'Jane", last_name: 'Doe"}</span></li>
                    <li><a href="">Conditionals</a>When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span class="purpletext">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="purpletext">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false <span class="purpletext">else</span> we execute this block of code;</li>
                    <li><a href="">Loops</a>There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times then you stop. lThat's a loop!</li>
                    <li><a href="">Function</a>Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
